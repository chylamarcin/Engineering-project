# Engineering project

Engineering project for studies. 
Used technologies: Java8, JavaFX, MySQL, Encog3, JPA/Hibernate.

Im using here Encog3 library to create basic neural network for backpropagation of exchanges values. 
Everything is in single JavaFX window. Program generate single network for single company. User need to create database manually for minimum four days to tryin predict value of day five.
Of course the predicted values are not accurate.
